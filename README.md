logsanalysis.sql is the primary sql table. there are three questions being addressed at the top with the sql statements the can be run to address them under each question. at the bottom of the list is an extra set of statements that can be run individually for extra evaluation of the data set.

there is a quote block at the bottom of the .sql page that is for reference only. It is to aid any testing if any sql statements fail during execution.
